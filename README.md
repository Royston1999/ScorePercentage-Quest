# ScorePercentage
A Beat Saber mod that shows extra information about your score!

## Features
- display the percentage at the end of a level instead of your rank
- display the score difference between the score you just set and your current highscore
- display the miss difference between your score and your current highscore (this only applies for maps played after installing the mod)
- display the percentage along with misses of all players at the end of a multiplayer level
- a popup UI in the level selection screen that shows extra information about your current highscore (includes misses, badcuts, play count, pauses, date played)

## Config
this mod saves extra information about your scores to the config. this allows for the mod to display such information in the popup UI. due to this, map played prior to the mod's installation will not include the data such as misses or badcuts
